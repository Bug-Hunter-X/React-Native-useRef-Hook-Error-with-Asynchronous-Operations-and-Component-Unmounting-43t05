# React Native useRef Hook Error with Async Operations and Unmounting

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the `useRef` hook in React Native with asynchronous operations.  The error occurs when a component unmounts before an asynchronous operation within `useRef` completes, leading to attempts to update a stale component reference.

## Bug Description
The primary issue is that the asynchronous operation inside `useEffect` continues even after the component is unmounted. When the async operation finishes, it tries to update the component using `myRef.current`, which is now `null`, resulting in a `TypeError`. 

## Solution
The solution involves checking if `myRef.current` is still valid before attempting to update it.  This prevents the error by gracefully handling the situation where the component has been unmounted.
