This error occurs when using the `useRef` hook in React Native with a component that is unmounted before the asynchronous operation within `useRef` completes.  The `useRef` object still holds a reference to the component even after it has been unmounted. When the asynchronous operation finishes, it tries to update the component using that stale reference, causing this error.  Example:

```javascript
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const myRef = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      const response = await fetch('some-url');
      const data = await response.json();
      //This will throw error if component unmounted before this line
      myRef.current.setState({ data }); 
    };
    fetchData();
    return () => {};
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      {/* ... */}
    </View>
  );
}
```
